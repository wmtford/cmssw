SplitClustersProducer, SplitCluster_MCtruth_cfi.py:  Rename the dE/dx
cut, use the right (derived) variable for the cut; add new dE/dx
threshold to avoid saving nearly zero-energy clusters.

1 Jun 2011  wtford -- V01-01-15
Move SplitClustersProducer.cc to plugins.  Replace Buildfiles with .xml,
rewritten to support inheritance of SplitClustersAlgos by
detAnalysis/ClusterNtuplizer.  Add parameters to set the dE/dx
calibration, limit the layers to which splitting is applied.

22 May 2010  wtford -- V01-01-14
SplitClustersAlgos:  Add overload of straightPathLength to take cluster
as argument and account for the measured local x.  (This only changes
the path length by ~1%, and has to be called within the cluster loop, so
may not be that useful.)

19 May 2010  wtford -- V01-01-13
SplitClustersProducer:  Cosmetic changes only (consistent indentation).

19 May 2010  wtford -- V01-01-12
Updates for CMSSW_3_5_X.
SplitClustersAlgos:  Add functions iniVertex, iniZvertex,
straightPathLength to set up the primary vertex from pixels, calculate
the effective path length for a straight track from this vertex through
the center of the sensor (origin of its local coordinates).
SplitClustersProducer:  Add a "no split" option for testing.  Location
was changed for SiStripClusterInfo.  Load the beam spot and pixel
vertices from the event.  Calculate normalized cluster charge, either
from MC truth or assuming a straight track from the pixel primary
vertex.  Base decision to split a cluster on the normalized charge.

13 Jan 2010  wtford -- V01-01-11
SplitClustersProducer:  Use the associateSimpleRecHitCluster signature
that's in CMSSW_3_4_X, so we won't need to check out the later version,
since the additional argument is no longer needed. 

25 Nov 2009  wtford -- V01-01-10
SplitClustersProducer:  Back out "Replace calls to hitAssociator with
inline code (should be faster)."  We now have reverted to V01-01-08 but
with function dumpDigiSimLinks.

20 Nov 2009  wtford -- V01-01-09
SplitClustersProducer:  Cosmetic changes only (consistent indentation);
printOut -> false.

20 Nov 2009  wtford
SplitClustersProducer:  Add a function to dump information to a flat
file for analysis.  Replace calls to hitAssociator with inline code
(should be faster).

10 Nov 2009  wtford -- V01-01-08
SplitClustersProducer:  Add code for splitBy:  byTracks, using the
fraction() method.  Also supports an unlimited number of clusters after
splitting. 

9 Nov 2009  wtford -- V01-01-07
SplitClustersProducer:  Change logic to fill all elements of amp arrays,
preserve special amp values 254, 255.  Debug printout is active in this
version. 

8 Nov 2009  wtford -- V01-01-06
SplitClustersProducer:  Split (byHits) by inserting the simHits in
cluster form, obtained by use of the fraction() method of the
DigiSimLinks. 

3 Nov 2009  wtford -- V01-01-05
Use new interface to TrackerHitAssociator::associateSimpleRecHitCluster,
which avoids calling it twice.
(needs SimTracker/TrackerHitAssociation V01-04-07)

27 Oct 2009  wtford -- V01-01-04
SplitClustersProducer:  Change call to
TrackerHitAssociator::associateSimpleRecHitCluster to match modified
interface in V01-04-06 of SimTracker/TrackerHitAssociation.

24 Oct 2009  wtford -- V01-01-03
SplitClustersProducer:  Remove loops on RecHits, since we now have
access to hit association directly from the cluster.  (Needs
SimTracker/TrackerHitAssociation V01-04-05.)
SplitClustersProducer, SplitClustersAlgos:  Add option to split clusters
associated with 2 SimTrackracks, as alternative to splitting when there
are 2 associated SimHits.  In the config one can now set
process.siStripSplitClusters = cms.EDProducer("SplitClustersProducer",
                                              splitBy = cms.string('byHits'))
or                                                                 'byTracks'

11 Oct 2009  wtford -- V01-01-02
SplitClustersProducer:  add method SplitClustersProducer::dumpSimTracks
to inspect the original and split clusters.  This requires also the tags
V06-01-08      DataFormats/TrackerRecHit2D                      
V01-04-04      SimTracker/TrackerHitAssociation                 
with a private modification to TrackerHitAssociator: new function
overload 
std::vector<PSimHit> associateSimpleRecHitCluster(const SiStripCluster*);

4 Oct 2009  wtford -- V01-01-01
Add new base class SplitClustersAlgos to provide leftStripCount() either
to this package or to ClusterAnalyzer.
SplitClustersProducer:  Add inheritance from SplitClustersAlgos and
remove leftStripCount() to SplitClustersAlgos.
Add plugins/SealModule.cc and plugins/Buildfile to create the library
needed by the Analyzer.

21 Sept 2009  wtford --
The producer job was leaking about 3MB per event.  This is true even if
the SplitClustersProducer::produce() method returns at the top.
The job crashes at event 649.
25 Sept., 2009
The leaky module is the trackInfo.  I learn from e-mail from Chiara
Genta that in fact trackInfo is obsolete and unsupported.  It suffices
just to eliminate the trackInfo module from the path.

Fixed a small bug in split cluster producer:  2nd cluster's left edge
was being placed at the center of the original cluster, rather than
adjacent to the new first cluster.

Add member function SplitClustersProducer::leftStripCount, since this
code is repeated twice in the producer.  Separate the producer
declaration into a header file (the idea was to make leftStripCount
accessible to the analyzer as well, but I've not succeeded with this so
far).

7 Aug 2009  wtford -- Migration from (Marco Cardaci's) CMSSW_2_1_9 to
CMSSW_3_1_2.
1.  Some complaints about the build file.  I just commented out the
offending lines.
2.  After much struggle, found the access to hits collection had to be
modified (here and in the stereo collection loop): 
210c210,214
<    for(SiStripRecHit2DCollection::const_iterator rechitsrphiIter = rechitsrphi->begin(); rechitsrphiIter != rechitsrphi->end(); ++rechitsrphiIter) {
---
>    const SiStripRecHit2DCollection::DataContainer& rechitsrphiColl = rechitsrphi->data();
>    for(SiStripRecHit2DCollection::DataContainer::const_iterator rechitsrphiIter = rechitsrphiColl.begin(); rechitsrphiIter != rechitsrphiColl.end(); ++rechitsrphiIter) {
>     const SiStripRecHit2D *aHit = &*(rechitsrphiIter);
> //     DetId mydet1 = aHit->geographicalId();
> //     if (idet.rawId() != mydet1.rawId()) continue;
212c216
<     if(rechitsrphiIter->cluster().isNonnull()){clust=&(*rechitsrphiIter->cluster());}
---
>     if(aHit->cluster().isNonnull()) {clust=&(*rechitsrphiIter->cluster());}
This is based on an example in 
CMSSW/Alignment/CommonAlignmentProducer/src/AlignmentTrackSelector.cc
